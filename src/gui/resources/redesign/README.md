# Redesign, JC-303, Amadeus Paulussen
## General
* All the graphics are exported as 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x PNGs as well as plain SVG variants.
* The fonts and Inkscape document are added in `src/` as well.

## Fonts
I tried to contact the author of the Omegle font used for the JC-303 logo, but I was never able to reach them. Not sure if this is a problem?
